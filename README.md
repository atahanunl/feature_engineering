# Diabetes Feature Engineering

## Business Problem

A machine learning model will be developed to predict whether individuals are diabetic based on specified features.
Prior to model development, it is anticipated that essential steps in data analysis and feature engineering will be
undertaken.

## Dataset Story

It is a part of a large dataset maintained by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in
the United States. The data is utilized for a diabetes study conducted on Pima Indian women aged 21 and above, residing
in Phoenix, the fifth-largest city in the state of Arizona. The target variable is indicated as `outcome`, with 1
denoting a positive diabetes test result and 0 indicating a negative result.

## Features

- `Pregnancies` - Number of pregnancies
- `Glucose` - Plasma glucose concentration at 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- `BloodPressure` - Diastolic blood pressure (mmHg)
- `SkinThickness` - Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- `Insulin` - Two-hour serum insulin (μU/ml)
- `BMI` - Body mass index (kg/m²)
- `DiabetesPedigreeFunction` - Diabetes pedigree function
- `Age` - Age (years)
- `Outcome` - Presence of the disease (1) or absence (0)
